Minimal React Project Template
------------------------------

Sets up React, React-DOM and Styled-Components by default


Uses Babel to compile JSX to JS

How to Use
----------
`npx degit sivteck/minimal-react-template my-react-project-name`


`npm install` in `./client` folder to install devDependencies (babel, nodemon)


`npm start` for development. Outputs build artifacts to devBuild folder with development versions of React and nodemon triggers rebuild when `js`/`css` files are changed.
